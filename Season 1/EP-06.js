/* undefined vs not defined in JS */

/* 

- if create a variable and don't initialize it with any value then the memory will be allocated to the variable and will contain its value as undefined and will remain throughout the program execution until we initialize the variable with a value
- javascript is a loosely typed language meaning the variable created can be assigned with a value of a particular datatype and later can be changed with a value of another datatype
